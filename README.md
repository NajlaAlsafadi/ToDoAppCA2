Mobile Application Development
Continuous Assessment 2
This assignment focuses on persistent data storage using Firebase (Authenticate and
Realtime/FireStore) or SQLite and Recycler View which is put in the context of a full
application, you can choose between Firebase and SQLite for data storage.
You are asked to create a mobile application to manage to do list of users. A user is defined
as having an email, password, a name and a phone number.
A user can create many to do tasks, a task has a category or tag, a description, a deadline
(date only) and a status. For example, tag: Study, description: submit proposal, due: 5/12/23
status: incomplete.
The database allows to record all user information and to-do tasks user made.
The application has the following functions:
- Allow user to sign up/sign in
- Allow user to view their name and phone number
- Allow user to create tasks
- Allow user to update status of a task
- Allow user to remove a task
- Display all tasks of the current user in RCV
- Search task of the current user by tag and display them – all details - in RCV (e.g.
search tag “sport”, then all tasks of sport are displayed)
- Search task of the current user by status and display them – all details- in RCV (e.g.
search status “done”, then all done tasks are displayed)
- Using suitable menu in the app
Extra functions/widgets:
Some examples of extra functions that if you want to add to the app to make it a better app:
- Combining multiple search criteria
- Using spinner for a list of tag, user can select from
- Allow user to add image profile
- Using dynamic search (textwatcher)
Etc.
Submission:
1. You will submit your whole project to BrightSpace (best way is compressing the project
folder in zip file)
2. You will run your app and explain the functions you implemented, record in a video and
submit the video. Your recording must include:
- Showing the structure of your DB
- Input data and showing all functions implemented
- Mention extra functions/self-learning widgets/GUI used, if applicable.
